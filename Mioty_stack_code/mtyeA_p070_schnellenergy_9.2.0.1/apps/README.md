# exampleMain.c

This example demonstrates how to transmit data over MIOTY to the server.

## File Purpose

 - This file was created to evaluate the current consumption by disabling the transmission functionality.

 - The code puts the board into a complete sleep mode.

 - Both the Temperature Sensor and Flash memory remain in deep sleep from the initial state.

 - As a result, the board operates at an ultra-low current of approximately 10 microamps.
